I am Marie, a 23-year old student. During my bachelor's programme in Psychology, I realized I was most interested by the statistical topics we discussed. After I obtained my bachelor's degree, I decided to apply for the master's programme Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences), in which I am currently enrolled.This year I am writing my thesis on the topic of using expert elicitation to shorten Cito's end of primary school test (in Dutch: "centrale eindtoets").

In my spare time I like to practise playing the Clarinet. I play in both the [Huisorkest orchestra](https://www.hethuisorkest.nl/) and the [MMT orchestra](http://www.mmtproducties.nl/).
